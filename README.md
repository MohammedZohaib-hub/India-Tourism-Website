# India-Tourism-Website
Project Which Made to explore the tourist places based on the state they are visting
I have developed a website aimed at exploring tourist places across India, with a focus on six states as the primary points of interest. The main features of the website include state selection, seasonal recommendations, detailed tourist place information, and easy navigation.
Key Features:
1.	State Selection:
o	When users enter the website, they see a map or list of Indian states, such as Telangana, Delhi, etc.
o	Users can click on any state to explore its tourist attractions.
2.	Seasonal Recommendations:
o	Before users dive into exploring a state, they are presented with recommendations on the best times to visit.
o	For example, Telangana can be visited year-round, while it is advised to avoid Himachal Pradesh during the rainy season due to potential landslides. The best times to visit would be summer or spring.
3.	Tourist Place Details:
o	Upon selecting a state, users are presented with a list of tourist places within that state.
o	As users hover over each place, they see the place name, details, and interesting facts.
o	Scrolling down provides more specific information about the state, including its history, significant events, rulers, and other pertinent details.
4.	User Navigation:
o	The website includes a menu option that allows users to easily navigate back and forth between different states to explore more attractions.
Educational Purpose:
•	This project is designed to educate users about the diverse and rich cultural heritage of Indian states.
•	It offers detailed historical and cultural information, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about India's tourist attractions.
